## Technical requirements for project:  

Objective - apply newly acquired backend skill sets to make a complete web application.

* Use Express as a foundation.
* Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
* Have 2 models or more - one for users and the other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app.
* Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
* Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
* Implement all CRUD actions on models other than users (should have create, read, update, and delete features even if they arenâ€™t all for the same model).
